# Meili - Arrival and Departure System

This system is meant to be a full solution providing arrival and departure
information and history for a transportation terminal (bus, train, etc).  The
three main components are the server, display console, and client interface.
See their respective directories for further information.

### Server
The server handles all the records' modification, addiditon, deletion, and
storage.

### Display Console
The display console is the non-interactive information terminal that patrons
will see.

### Client Interface
The client interface enables administration of the server's records.

## Project Status
Currently only the display console is in a stable state, although it does
lack polish.  The server is not feature complete and the main focus of current
development.  The client interface doesn't exist yet as it relies on the
completion of the server.
